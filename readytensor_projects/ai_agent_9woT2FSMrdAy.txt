Abstract"This publication introduces an autonomous AI agent designed for natural language query handling and task automation. It combines modular Python code with proven datasets to streamline intelligent response generation and decision-making workflows."Methodologyclass AiAgent:definit(self, name):self.name = namedef respond(self, query):if 'hello' in query.lower():return f'Hello! I am {self.name}'return 'Can you clarify your request?'We leveraged the arcee-ai/agent-data dataset for conversational modeling. The agent’s logic flow is visualized below:Results"- The AI agent accurately responded to user queries in real-time.
